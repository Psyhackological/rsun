Your Command-Line Enlightenment.

### :question: Why

I aim to challenge myself by creating a comprehensive suite of smooth, functional CLI tools using Rust. These tools will be accessible through three different environments: 

1. **Localhost** - via Bash scripting for local system management.
2. **Multiple Hosts** - using Ansible for orchestration across many hosts.
3. **Containers** - through Docker for containerized deployment and testing.

This approach will allow me to explore different deployment methods and ensure robust, versatile tools.

## :clipboard: todo!

- [ ] :ambulance: Try to solve cross-distro problem

### :whale: Docker

- [ ] :cd: Choose base image
- [ ] :globe_with_meridians: Maybe upload it to quad.io or docker hub

### :a: Ansible

- [ ] :people_hugging: Try to utilize [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)
- [ ] :game_die: Write basic playbook

### :shell: Bash


### :man_shrugging: Something else?

- [ ] :robot: Think about other ways to automate this.
- [ ] :thinking: What about TOML, JSON, YAML configs?
- [ ] :repeat: CI/CD for automation
- [ ] :open_file_folder: Add option for compiling from source or downloading binaries
